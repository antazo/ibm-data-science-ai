    "# Final Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In todayâ€™s digital economy, credit card transactions are a cornerstone of financial activity but are increasingly vulnerable to fraud, costing billions annually. Traditional fraud detection methods, such as manual reviews and rule-based systems, struggle to keep pace with the complexity and volume of modern fraudulent activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a machine learning-based credit card fraud detection system to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. By analyzing transaction data, the system will classify legitimate and suspicious activities, focusing on minimizing false positives and false negatives. Various algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks, will be evaluated to determine the most effective model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report outlines the data preparation, model development, and evaluation process, emphasizing the critical role of machine learning in enhancing financial security and reducing fraud risks."
